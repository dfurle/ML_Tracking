## Machine Learning for Physics Particle Tracking

---
Using Geant4 to generate data, either straight or curved tracks

Saving hits to .root file and using Cern ROOT script to mix and resort data to simulate a bunch 

Python Jupyter Notebook (not in this repo at the moment) to generate and train model using sorted data from ROOT

Convert Keras model to FPGA
